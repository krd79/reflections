What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden git folder is created. It does not commit any changes or track any files. 
However, it needs to be done so that when a commit takes place and files are
tracked, then any changes and tracking can be saved in this hidden .git folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area adds files that are to be tracked by git from the working
directory and will be committed following the next commit command. It 
allows someone to decide which files they want to commit in one logical commit 
and I expect you can alter your choices. Otherwise, you would be creating too 
many commits, if you wanted to change the addition of files that have already 
been committed.
